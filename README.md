A roguelike game written for the 7drl challenge 2013

I've been coding all night and I'm going to sleep a while now.
I'll write an explanation of the game here (https://github.com/vidarn/mgrl) as soon as I wake up.

You are more than wellcome to try the game out, but proper instructions will probably enhance the experience.

I'll tell you the controlls at least:

hjklyubn - move/attack
i - inventory
q - drink
g - pick up
Q - quiver
f - fire (ranged weapon)
o - open (container, doors open by just bumping in to them)
w - wield
d - drop
> - descend stairs
< - ascend stairs

Game instructions (will update when I've slept)
Your goal is to get to dungeon level 15 and retrieve the Orb of Knowledge

Build instructions:
Ive only tried it on linux but plan on doing a windows compilation tomorrow
The only dependencies are libtcod and boost

Compilation should be as easy as just typing Make (hopefully)

Best of luck!
